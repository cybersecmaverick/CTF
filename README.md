# CTF

This repository is a collection of CTF write-ups, scripts and cheatsheets I will be creating while participating in Cyber Security Capture The Flag events (CTFs).

CTF is an exciting and hands-on way of learning many cyber security and pentesting skills. As a new CTF player, I aim to document my journey and create a repository of useful scripts I will be using during my journey to accelerate my learning of the ways of ethical hacking :)

Please feel Feedback or collaboration on code and scripts I have published are welcome.
