# CTF

This repository is a collection of CTF write-ups, scripts and cheatsheets I will be creating while participating in Cyber Security Capture The Flag events (CTFs).

CTF is an exciting and hands-on way of learning many cyber security and pentesting skills. 
As a new CTF player, I aim to document my journey and create a repository of useful scripts and documents I will be using during CTFs to accelerate my learning of the ways of ethical hacking while having fun at the same time :)

Please feel free to give me your valuable feedback or collaborate with me on code, documents or scripts I have published.
